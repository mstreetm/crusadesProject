            <h2>Spark</h2>
            <p>
              The second crusade was sparked by the capture of Edessa by the Turks in 1144.
              Pope Eugenius III called for the crusade in 1145, and it began in 1147 under the leadership of Emperor Conrad III of Germany and King Louis VII of France with the goal of recapturing Edessa.
              Unlike the First Crusade, the Byzantine Emperor(now Manuel Comnenus) did not fully support the second crusade.

            <h2>Battles</h2>
            <p>
              Conrad’s army arrived in Constantinople in September 1147, and set out for Anatolia leading the forces past Nicea.
              The troops were almost annihilated at Dorylaeum on October 25 and retreated to Nicea.
              Louis arrived in Constantinople in October 1147, and reached Nicea in November.
              Joining with the remainder of Conrad’s army, the two set out along the coastal route and arrived in Ephesus.
              Once in Ephesus, Conrad became ill and had to return to Constantinople for medical care.
            </p>
            <p>
              The crossing from Ephesus to Antioch was harrowing in that the French were not only fighting the Muslims but the Christians as well, as Manuel needed to defend his cities from the crusaders.
              After arriving in Antioch, it became clear that the original goal of recapturing Edessa would no longer be possible.
              The Turks had killed off the Christian inhabitants of the city, which would make its recapture difficult with the forces that Louis had available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Louis and his troops marched to Jerusalem, where Conrad had gone after he recoveredand an army of nearly 50,000 was amassed, the largest crusader army assembled so far.
              After deliberations, the army departed for Damascus.
              They arrived in Damascus on July 24th 1148, but they were forced to stop their siege only four days later, when Turkish forces arrived, forcing the crusaders to retreat.

            <h2>Parting Ways</h2>
            <p>
              After this defeat, the kings parted ways.
              Conrad went to Constantinople to help Manuel with the pesky King Roger II of Siscily, who was pestering the greek coastline.
              Louis joined that same Roger and tried to start a crusade against Manuel in Constantinople, who Louis decided had made him fail in his crusade.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
              The second Crusade caused dismay amongst the Christians who had hoped for its success; however the Muslims were encouraged by the crusade’s collapse.
