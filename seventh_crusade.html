            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              A Seventh Crusade was called by Pope Innocent IV in June 1245, after King Louis IX of France, declared his intention to lead a new crusade.
              Louis was the ideal crusader, respected by his people and truly believing in the crusade.
              His army, numbering 15,000 and including many French nobles, departed France in August 1248, arriving in Cyprus in September, where they again decided to attack Egypt.

            They left for Egypt in May 1249, and had conquered Damietta in June.
            With reinforcements from France arriving and the death of the sultan, the army decided to focus on Cairo.
            In February 1250, one of Louisâ€™s Brothers, Robert of Artois, attacked an Egyptian camp near Mansourah, but ended up trapped within.
            Louis had to fight a battle to get him out, however, that battle was extremely costly to the crusading force.

              Heading further into Egypt, the crusaders stopped receiving supply ships from Damietta because they were intercepted by the Egyptians, which caused famine and disease among the troops.
              Louis was still committed to his cause and refused to flee; before long being captured by the Egyptians along with most of his army.
              Most of his people were killed, however, the king and his nobles were held for ransom.
              The king was released on May 6, 1250, in exchange for Damietta, but stayed in the area, feeling honor-bound to secure the release of as many of his nobles as possible.
              Before returning to France in April 1254, he helped strengthen the defenses of the Second Kingdom, wanting to return and lead the region someday.

              In 1258, a group of Mongols overtook Baghdad, resulting in the end of the Abbasid Caliphate.
               In 1260, the Mamluks of Egypt, led by Sultan Baybars of Egypt, stopped the southern advance of the Mongols.
               The Latin states of the area allied with either the Mongols(Armenia, Antioch-Tripoli) or the Muslims(Acre/Second Kingdom).
               Baybars destroyed the Crusader states over the next few years until his death in 1277, taking Caesarea, Haifa, and Arsuf in 1265, Galilee, and Cilician Armenia in 1266, and Antioch in 1268.

            <p>
              The Seventh Crusade could have been less of a disaster if it had retreated earlier or if it had joined the Sixth as originally intended.
