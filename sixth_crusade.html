            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              The sixth crusade was led by Emperor Frederic II of the Holy Roman Empire.
              He was supposed to help in the Fifth Crusade, but was granted several postponements by Pope Gregory VIII; his were the troops that Pelagius was desperately waiting for.
              Most of the Crusade left the Holy Roman Empire in the summer of 1227, but Frederic did not leave with it due to illness.

          <div class="journey">
            <h2>Journey</h2>
            <p>
              While ill, Frederic received messengers from the Sultan of Egypt, Al-Malik al-Kamil, who indicated that he was willing to negotiate.
              Pope Gregory was frustrated with Fredericâ€™s frequent delays and excommunicated the emperor.
              Frederic made it to Cyprus on July 21, 1228, after leaving the Holy Roman Empire in the summer of 1228.
              When Frederic reached Acre, news of his ex-communication had arrived and few chose to support him in his crusade; thus, he had no choice but to re-open negotiations with the Sultan.

          <div class="treaty">
            <h2>The Treaty of Jaffa</h2>
            <p>
              In 1229, a treaty agreement was reached, to last for 10 years.
              <ul>
                <li>The crusaders would gain Jerusalem, Bethlaham, and a strip of land leading from the cities to the ocean.</li>
                <li>The Muslims would keep the Temple area, the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.</li>
                <li>All current Muslim residents of Jerusalem would keep their property and homes; they would also be governed by a separate set of officials.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="Jerusalem">
            <h2>Jerusalem</h2>
            <p>
              Frederic had a claim to the throne of Jerusalem through his infant son Conrad, and was crowned when he reached Jerusalem.
              After he was crowned he quickly left in order to pacify the pope.
              While the treaty sounded good in theory, the split government of Jerusalem did not work, and the areas that the Crusaders gained were not defensible.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="after">
            <h2>After</h2>
            <p>
             In the following years, Jerusalem and Cyprus started civil wars as Frederic governed very differently than the previously established government of these places(Frederick also had conrol of the government of Cyprus).
             This led to division in the area and made it much easier for the Muslims to take Jerusalem in 1239 when the peace treaty had expired.  While the city was regained in 1241, it was held only briefly before it was taken again for the final time in 1244.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
              This crusade was theoretically good due to its treaties, but practically had little effect and might have been worse for the region overall.
