            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              Pope Innocent III started planning for a fifth crusade almost immediately after the fourth one went wrong, and was ready to call one by 1213.
              He had learned from the fourth crusade that this new one must be controlled by the church.
              The crusade was called by Pope Innocent IIIâ€™s successor, Pope Honorius III, in 1215.
              Its main goal was to capture Jerusalem, however, it was to do so after taking over Egypt to weaken the Muslims.

            <h2>Damietta</h2>
            <p>
              The first crusader army to reach the holy land, led by King Andrew of Hungary, reached Acre in the Fall of 1217, but left shortly after in January 1218.
              In April 1218 a fleet arrived bearing German, Italian, and Frisian Crusaders, which joined the remnants of the Hungarian troops.
              The force set out for Egypt in May 1218, led by King John of Brienne, King of the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem.
              The Crusaders captured a tower at the Egyptian city of Damietta in August 1218 but made no more progress on the city until November 5th, 1219.
            </p>
            <p>
              In September of 1218, a French army of Crusaders, led by Cardinal-Legate Pelagius, arrived.
              The two groups both maintained that they should be the ones leading the Crusade, John because he was there first, and Pelagius because he was there on behalf of the church.
              Peace offers were made by the Muslims in February 1219, involving extremely favorable terms, but while King John wanted to accept the terms, Pelagius refused to entertain the idea.
              After Damietta was finally taken, nothing happened for more than a year, Pelagius expecting the arrival of more troops; however, they never showed up.
            </p>
            <h2>March on Cairo</h2>
            <p>
              Pelagius decided that the Crusaders should advance on Cairo in July 1221, but one of their campsites was flooded while the Crusaders were sleeping and they were forced to surrender.
              To save their lives, the Crusaders were forced to abandon Damietta and leave Egypt, having achieved nothing.
            </p>

          <div class="Legacy">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
              This crusade failed mainly because Pelagius was a poor leader, but insisted on leading anyway, as well as because the reinforcements that Pelagius was expecting never came.
