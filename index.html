      <h2>What were the Crusades?</h2>
      <p>The crusades were a series of military campaigns, fought between Muslims and Christians, primarily waged as attempts for the Christians to take control of Jerusalem and the Holy land from the Muslims.
        In all, there were 8 official crusades, as well as a 9th that is sometimes grouped with the 8th.
        There have also been numerous unofficial crusades such as the Children's Crusade and crusades to other places like the Baltics and Spain(but with similar goals, to take back holy sites and stop the spread of Islam).
        The crusades lasted from 1095-1291, almost 200 years between the launch of the first crusade to the Levant until the fall of the last crusader cities.
        Although crusades to the Levant stopped after this, crusades to other places continued for centuries. </p>
