      <h2>What were the Crusades?</h2>
      <p>The crusades were a series of military campaigns, fought between Muslims and Christians, primarily waged as attempts for the Christians to take control of Jerusalem and the Holy land from the Muslims.  In all, there were 8 official crusades, as well as a 9th that is sometimes grouped with the 8th.  There have also been numerous unofficial crusades such as the Childerns Crusade and crusades to other places(but with similar goals, to take back holy sites).</p>
