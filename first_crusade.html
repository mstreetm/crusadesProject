              The first crusade started in 1095 with a response to a call for help from Emperor Alexius I of Byzantium to Pope Urban II.
              The Seljuk Turks were encroaching on the Emperor’s southern border and the emperor asked the pope for troops to help take control of this threat and recapture the holy city of Jerusalem.
              The pope called for people to take up arms in November of this year, and the people answered; not only soldiers, but ordinary citizens took up the call and started preparing to fight.
              These people wore a cross as a symbol of their devotion to the church, and were motivated by promises of forgiveness for sins and the possibility of gaining wealth or notoriety.

            <h2>People's Crusade</h2>
            <p>
              Before the four main armies of the First Crusade formed and set out, a less organized band of crusaders set out under the command of a preacher known as Peter the Hermit.
              When these forces, known as the “People’s Crusade” reached Constantinople, the disregarded the advice of Emperor Alexius to wait for the main armies, and set out for the holy land.
              This led to their massacre by the Turks in Cibotus, a city near Dinar in modern day Turkey.
            </p>
            <h2>The Main Armies</h2>
            <p>
              The four armies set out in August of 1096, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, Raymond of Saint-Gilles, Bohemond of Taranto, and Robert of Flanders.
              When they arrived in Constantinople, Emperor Alexius demanded these leaders recognize his sovereignty over any land that was reclaimed, as well as swear oaths of loyalty to him.
              Of the leaders, only Bohemond took the oath willingly.

            <p>
              Starting in May 1097, the crusaders along with the Byzantine armies started their attacks on the Turks, taking first Nicea, which was the Seljuk capital in Anatolia.
              The city, now called Iznik, surrendered to the armies in late June.
              A year later, the armies captured Antioch and continued their march toward Jerusalem.
              Jerusalem was not occupied by the Turks but by the Egyptian Fatimids, enemies of the Turks because of religious differences(the Turks practiced Sunni Islam and the Fatimids practiced Shi’ite Islam).
            </p>
            <p>
              The armies(With the exception of Bohemond, who had elected to stay in Antioch) started a siege on Jerusalem in June 1099.
              The city’s governor surrendured to them on July 15th, 1099, slaughtering hundreds of people in their entrance into the city despite giving a promise of protection.
              After this victory, many of the crusaders headed home, leaving the remainder to establish the Crusader States, one in Antioch, Edessa, Jerusalem and Tripoli, the latter of which was not established until 1109.

              The first crusade was the most successful of all the crusades, and led the way for 30 years of Christian occupation of the region, until the defeat of Edessa by the Turks in 1144, which sparked the Second Crusade.
