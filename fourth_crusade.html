            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              A new crusade was called in 1198 by Pope Innocent III in order to retake the city of Jerusalem.
              After the original leader Thibaut of Champagne died, Boniface of Montferrat was selected to lead the crusade.
              Unfortunately, Boniface had some personal goals in leading the crusade, one of which was to put someone else on the Byzantine throne.
              This someone else was Alexius IV, Boniface's cousin and the nephew of the Byzantine emperor, confusingly called Alexius III.
            </p>

          <div class="detour">
            <h2>Zadar</h2>
            <p>
              When the crusaders arrived in Venice in 1202 for transport to the Holy land, the army was only one-third of the expected size, which meant that the crusaders neither needed nor could afford the ships and provisions they had contracted for.
              The Venetians convinced the crusaders that if they would help capture the city of Zadar, that they would be allowed to postpone repayment of the contract.
              Zadar was captured in November 1202, and the crusaders spent the winter there.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="treaty">
            <p>
              While in Zadar, an offer was made by Alexius the nephew.  If the crusaders would depose Alexius III to put Alexius IV on the throne, then Alexius IV would:
              <ul>
                <li>Pay the Christians a large sum of money.</li>
                <li>Put the Byzantine church in submission to the Roman church.</li>
                <li>Join in the crusade to Egypt.</li>
              </ul>
              This offer was accepted, and the crusaders sailed to Constantinople by way of Corfu, arriving in June 1203.

            <h2>Constantinople</h2>
            <p>
              The crusaders attacked and set fire to a portion of the northeast corner of the city, and that caused the citizens of Constantinople to turn against Alexius III and put Alexius IV on the throne.
              Despite attempts, Alexius IV failed to follow through with his promises, and due to Latin hatred in Constantinople and the fact that Alexius IV owed his throne to the Latins, he was deposed in January 1204.
            </p>
            <p>
              The crusaders, now robbed of their reward, declared war on Constantinople and took the city on April 12, 1204.
              The crusaders were not kind to the city or its inhabitants, killing, raping, violating, stealing from, and generally destroying them.
              The crusaders put Baldwin of Flanders on the Byzantine throne and put Thomas Morosini in charge of the church as patriarch.
              The city would again be taken in Michael VIII Palaeologus in 1261.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
              The Fourth Crusade ended without having even gotten near the land that it was supposed to be crusading to, and with the Greeks feeling deeply betrayed by the Latins.
              It also finished the Great Schism, the servering of the Catholic and Orthodox churches.
